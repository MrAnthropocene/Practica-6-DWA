# **Practice 6: Local Storage Integration**
## **Overview**
This project demonstrates the integration of Local Storage in web development by implementing a book management system. The objective is to explore how data can be stored, retrieved, modified, and deleted using Local Storage, applying best practices for client-side data persistence.

## **Features**
*Store book information in Local Storage, including basic details and a representative image.
*Edit and update book entries directly from the user interface.
*Remove books from storage with a simple action.
*Display stored books dynamically, either on the entry page or on a dedicated listing page.
## **Technical Details**
*Utilizes JavaScript for managing Local Storage operations.
*Implements DOM manipulation to dynamically update the UI.
*Ensures data persistence even after the page is refreshed.
## **Usage**
*Open the application in a browser.
*Add a book by providing the required information and selecting an image.
*View the list of stored books on the dedicated page.
*Edit or delete books as needed.
## **Conclusion**
This practice reinforces the understanding of Local Storage as a powerful tool for client-side data management, providing a hands-on approach to persistent web data handling without requiring a backend.
